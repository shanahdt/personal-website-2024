summary: Some reflections on advising and mentoring.

I was recently honored to receive a mentorship award from the Society for Music Perception and Cognition
at their conference in Banff. That, and a panel for trainees that was a part of the conference
have left me wanting to reflect on some "guiding principles" that have emerged now that I've been in an advising capacity
for ten (!) years. 

Having said that, I don't think I can claim that I'm the best advisor in the world, but I can say that I've gotten much better at it. 
Nobody teaches you to be an advisor, and we're all just kind of thrown into it and expected to know exactly what we're doing, 
but most of the time it's just super scary that someone is entrusting us with so much responsibility.
Over time, however, I think that I've learned how to deal with people better, and also to be more understanding of where people might be coming from. 
I think I've become more empathetic, and try to communicate this as well as I can. So here are some things that I find myself telling students on a fairly regular basis (in no particular order).

## You are More than What You Produce

I think academics tend to tie their self-worth to their research output, 
thinking that if they don't publish five things every year, and put every thought 
they have on arxiv, that they will be a failure. I find myself 
repeating to students this mantra "You are more than what you produce", 
as a way of reminding them that their value is not tied to what they write or publish. 
Humans have inherent value, and that includes academics. 


## Living a Balanced Life is Actually a Good Thing

You aren't working on papers all night after a full day of coursework and your teaching assistantship duties? For shame!

Some of the most productive scholars I know also eschew this stereotype of the lonely tweedy soul avoiding others to work on something Very Important. My academic heroes
also make time for their families, run marathons, knit, are community organizers, and more. 
And here's the thing: that makes them better academics. These things can often inform your research questions
and actually make your work (and you) more interesting. 

You didn't write that lit review I asked for because you were teaching banjo? That's cool. Why does playing banjo interest you? 
Do you want it to connect to your research? It doesn't have to, of course.


## You Don't Have to Know Everything

I sometimes freak out that I don't know enough of X programming language or Y statistical methods or Z repertoire. But that's OK. I'm not a 
computer scientist, or a statistician, and I really can only know so much repertoire at a time. But that's OK. I like
that a breadth of knowledge can inform my broader research questions, and I think that one of the best things about cross-disciplinary
work is actually that feeling of always needing to learn more. It's actually a good thing to not be complacent with what you know...

More soon probably. These are just the main thoughts for a first post on this website.
